## **BIFX551 - Advanced Data Analytics Programming with R - SPRING 2024**

### Course Description:

This class introduces the R programming language and advanced concepts and techniques to discover patterns in data. Students will explore datasets by identifying variables with the most predictive power, and developing and assessing predictive models in R. Discussion topics include exploratory data analysis, visualization, and data transformation. Students will implement the following data mining techniques: regression, neural networks, classification, clustering, principal component analysis, and survival analysis. Advanced techniques such as bagging, boosting, and random forests will also be explored. Significant time will be spent learning to program within an integrated development environment and implementing version tracking.

### Learning Objectives
On completion of the course, students should be comfortable with the following:
* Best practices for developing code
* R programming and package development within RStudio
* Version tracking and Collaborative software development using GitHub / git
* Creating Data visualizations to be able to understand information about a given dataset
* Linear regression and other data mining techniques

### Grading
* Homework (30%): Short reading assignments and exercises that reinforce what is discussed in class. 
* Course Projects (60%): There will be 3 course projects throughout the semester.
* Attendance and participation (10%): Being active on discord and in class. Do not be afraid to ask questions because I am sure you won't be the only one who is thinking it.
* Homework is due by the end of the day on next class (or what would be the next class).
* Late work will not be accepted. 
* Hood's Grading Scale:

| Letter Grade | Final Percentage |
|:------------:|:----------------:|
|A| 94 - 100%|
|A-| 90 - 93.9%|
|B+|	87 - 89.9%|

|F|	< 70%|

### Academic Integrity
You are expected to abide by the honor code and include it on your assignments. All work you turn in should be your own, or the work of your group in the case of a group project. If you have any questions about what is acceptable help, ask me.

### Accommodations for Disabilities
This course is intended to be accessible for all students, including those with mental, physical, or cognitive disabilities, illness, injuries, impairments, or any other condition that tends to negatively affect oneâ€™s equal access to education. If at any point in the term, you find yourself not able to fully access the space, content, and experience of this course, you are welcome (and not required) to contact me by email, phone, or during office hours to discuss your specific needs. I also encourage you to contact the Office of Accessibility Services (301-696-3421 or AccessibilityServices@hood.edu). If you have a diagnosis or history of accommodations in high school or previous postsecondary institutions, Accessibility Services can help you document your needs and create an accommodation plan. By making a plan through Accessibility Services, you can ensure appropriate accommodations without disclosing your condition or diagnosis to course instructors.
