## **BIFX551 - Advanced Data Analytics Programming with R - SPRING 2024**

Brandon Lasher

### Course Description:

This class introduces the R programming language and advanced concepts and techniques to discover patterns in data. Students will explore datasets by identifying variables with the most predictive power, and developing and assessing predictive models in R. Discussion topics include exploratory data analysis, visualization, and data transformation. Students will implement the following data mining techniques: regression, neural networks, classification, clustering, principal component analysis, and survival analysis. Advanced techniques such as bagging, boosting, and random forests will also be explored. Significant time will be spent learning to program within an integrated development environment and implementing version tracking.

### Learning Objectives
On completion of the course, students should be comfortable with the following:
* Best practices for developing code
* R programming and package development within RStudio
* Version tracking and Collaborative software development using GitHub / git
* Creating Data visualizations to be able to understand information about a given dataset
* Linear regression and other data mining techniques

### Grading
* Homework (25%): Short reading assignments and exercises that reinforce what is discussed in class. 
* Course Projects (60%): There will be 3 course projects throughout the semester.
* Attendance and participation (15%): Being active on discord and in class. Do not be afraid to ask questions becuase I am sure you won't be the only one who is thinking it.
* Hood Grading Scale:
