## About me
### Work Experience 
My first position out of college was in a neuroscience lab studying stress response pathways and aging at the University of Michigan. After a year, I moved to Baltimore and began working at Johns Hopkins in a virology lab focused on HIV and Hepatitis B. When COVID hit I transitioned to SARS-CoV-2 research and moved to Frederick. I currently work on Ft. Detrick researching BSL4 pathogens.

Here are some _BSL4_ _pathogens_!
* Ebolavirus
* Marburg virus
* Lassa virus
* Nipah virus

### Why am I taking this class?
I have a **very** basic understanding of R and Python and really want to get a better grasp on programming so I can apply it to my research. 

### Hobbies and interests
I love to camp with my girlfriend and the dogs. Here is Tippy! <br>
