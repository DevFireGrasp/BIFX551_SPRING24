# This is my biography
## About me
**My name is Isabella.** But people call me Izzy for short sometimes. I am a _retired rugby player_ who is trying to find other activities that I enjoy. 
## My current obsessions are:
* Reading
* Baking
  * Cinnamon rolls
  * English muffins
* Starting but never finishing crochet projects
* Browsing Zillow for houses I will never be able to afford
* Board games

This is me from the past summer scuba diving in the Great Barrier Reef with my girlfriend. I saw a **shark!**
## Why Bioinformatics?
|  | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | I want a work-from home job. I am tired of going into a lab 5 days a week. |
| 2 | I want to work with data from experiments rather than doing them myself. |
| 3 | More money? |
| 4 | I have no computer skills and need help. |
