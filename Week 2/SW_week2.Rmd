```{r cars}
summary(cars)

Note: You can see that there is a general trend that the longer higher the speed the longer it takes to stop. This is what someone might expect however something to keep in mind for this data is that it was recorded in 1920. One could speculate that the trend still holds true but I would be very supprised if the distances needed to stop are still the same. Also should be noted that there are 50 observations, which is relitively small when you consider all of the testing on cars we do now.
